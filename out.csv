145431382,english,"Latest Update 9/21/2023: The people who have the ""Just as Planned"" pack is fine, we are getting everything including the paid DLCs. 

For those who don't know what's happening, PeroPero recently announced that there is going to be DLC that is not going to be for those who have the ""Just as Planned"" Pack. People got angry because PeroPero promised the people who bought the pack would be a 1 time purchase thing, where future updates and DLCs will be provided for free to those who had the pack. The recent announcement claimed that there was going to be paid DLC that is not part of the ""Just as Planned"" Pack, so there was some review bombing.

Recently, however, PeroPero came out with another announcement, where they stated that:
1. Those who have the ""Just as Planned"" Pack will get the paid DLC and future paid DLCs for free, [strike] as long as they log in during a week of the DLC dropping. This will be permanent, so if you log in the week of the DLC dropping, you will have it forever. [/strike]
They recently came out with an announcement that whoever has the ""Just as Planned"" Pack will get all future DLC for free.

2. The ""Just as Planned"" Pack will be discontinued, but those who already have it will keep it. (Kinda like a Kickstarter backer reward)

3. The ""Just as Planned"" Pack will be replaced with ""Muse Plus"". (Basically the ""Just as Planned"" Pack but without the benefit of getting the paid DLCs for free)

The replacing of the ""Just as Planned"" Pack and the Vocaloid DLC dropping will supposedly happen near or on Oct. 4, 2023.

69889902,english,"[h1][b]”Come for flashy visuals, Stay for catchy music”[/b][/h1]

Muse Dash is a rhythm action game developed by Chinese studio called PeroPeroGames. Steam version is completed mobile port which share same price of base game.

Muse Dash is like a warm place where you sit back and enjoy both music and visual. Subjectively, I was drawn colorful art design and stylish flashy characters (which remind me of anime like Panty and Stocking). The game has hybrid concept between side-scrolling beat ‘em up on the rail and rhythm beat which are executed very well.

[h1]Parkour Rhythm on The Rail[/h1]
The control is tight and responsive compared to mobile touch pad. You simply control character using two keyboard buttons (which can be modified or set alternate keys via option). One key is to hit enemy notes at ground level and another one is to hit enemy notes on the air. It sounds simple, but also challenges sense of rhythm of player where you face variant types of note from common long note to invisible note. Dodging sawblade notes and utilizing your timing to maintain combo and character HP to the end of song.

[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2065335523[/url]
Similar to other rhythm games, the game has judge system (indicates input accuracy based on timing), but is more much simplified and forgiving as “Perfect”, “Great”, “Pass”, and “Miss” that will break your current combo and affect overall accuracy. The game will also enter “Fever mode” once player maintains amount of combo, allow player to boost score in short period and can be set as manual spacebar key.

[h1]Three Characters, Different Gimmicks [/h1]
Your starter character is Rin. By completing any songs regardless of difficulty, you will gain user EXP for leveling up. Each level will unlock random troves used to unlock new playable characters (Rin, Buro, Marija), new elfins (supporting companions), and many beautiful illustration (allow you to customize loading screen). The process is random and varied for each user, but player will easily unlock everything at certain point.

Speaking of characters, each main character has different 4-5 costumes, theme, and likeable personalities. Both costumes and elfins provide player benefit one way or another based on playstyle and specific gimmick. Some can match up with elfin to boost extra scores or maintain HP. Some can use to boost overall accuracy or lengthen judge area to the point you feel comfortable and familiar with beats. The system is friendly for casual players while keeping master challenge for veterans.

[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2065335895[/url]
[h1]Enjoy as Casual or Master Favorite Songs[/h1]
The game offers 3 difficulties (Easy, Hard, and Master except for few default songs). Master difficulty only unlock when player completes “S Rank” on hard (90% accuracy). Higher difficulty contains more notes that synchronize most beats of the track or completely replace different sequences from Easy and Hard. It may sounds hard on paper, but as I consider myself as average player for this genre. It’s common for every rhythm games that you invest time for practicing to the point that it becomes muscle memory. Combine with strong visual feedback from beating wave of enemy notes and bosses at end of level. It’s such an addictive and satisfying gameplay loop that I genuinely enjoy everyday regardless of scoreboard.

[h1]Embrace The Melody[/h1]
Muse Dash offers great variety of songs (both vocal and instrumental). For example: dubstep, eurobeat, EDM, Jazz, vlolin, vocaloid, pop, mystical, BMS, and other mixup. You may expect some Chinese vocal songs and some Japanese songs. But they are overall catchy and aesthetic in their own way. It also encourages me to dig into meaningful lyrics and discover more talented cover / composers. There are some familiar songs that share among other rhythm games (Arcaea, DJMax, Maimai, and more) such as “conflict”, “Destr0yer”, “PUPA”, “MilK”, and much more.

[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2110466357[/url]
[h1]Base Game and Just as planned DLC[/h1]
The base game has total 52 initial songs (43 default songs, 3 Nanocore, 6 Budget is Burning) with $3 price tag served as standard version, provide full access of all characters and elfins to experiment. It’s worth checking without DLC to get a grasp how the game plays out.

While mobile version has various bundles, Steam version has single DLC called “Just as planned” with current 132 extra songs (free 6 songs will be added every month). This DLC serves as one-time payment for long-term support if player really interests into the gameplay and music types. I personally think $30 price tag is reasonably worth considering amount of licensed songs the developers have to pay and generate notes for each song. If you’re still uncomfortable for a price and expectation which understandable in some regions, you can follow the game page and wait for DLC sale.

[h1]Performance and (some) Nitpickings[/h1]
Muse Dash runs on Unity game engine with friendly spec requirement and well optimization. I had no performance issue or FPS drop during 37 hours of playtime. Stylish and flashy UI, but easy to navigate between menus. Due to mobile design, you need to press ESC from main menu to exit the game.

Aside from fantastic visual and gameplay loop, there are few cons I found that can be problematic to new player such as transition effect of Fever mode can be bad distraction. In few songs, enemy notes in some portions doesn’t sync perfectly to music beat or slightly offbeat especially on high level Master difficulty. However, you can adjust offset delay if the problem relates to your monitor. Same as background brightness if you feel like notes are blending to backdrop. Lastly, I notice register / delay problem of daily challenge at least on latest patch. 

[h1]Closing[/h1]
Muse Dash is a rhythm game with its own identity. Solid gameplay, high replayability, and satisfying feeling of hitting beats as music enthusiast. It’s something I could enjoy from hard day and share experience with friends in Discord. Wherever you’re not familiar with rhythm genre or not, Muse Dash is another title that worth checking.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

[h1] Written Review [/h1]
Muse Dash is a colourful rhythm game with a good variety in music and a satisfying gameplay loop.

The game's music is overall ""Anime"", but they manage to mix it up. Some of it is more cutesy and dancey, while others take cues from jazz or swing, and others are a bit more hardcore or dubstep-y. I thought the quality of the soundtrack overall was really awesome, and I've had songs stuck in my head for weeks since playing this game.

On top of that, I actually have just found myself gravitating towards playing the game a bit everyday. That's because of the great gameplay.

It's simple, but has enough depth to it to make you feel cool when you nail a string of notes.

So the way the game works, is you play with only two buttons. (This is because the game was initially designed as a mobile game) You press one button to attack at ground level, and one button to attack in the air. Then all you need to do is time your attacks with the notes that come your way, Guitar-Hero-style. 

The game mixes it up by having some held notes, some notes that turn invisible after a while, or some that have you button mash as much as possible. But the more interesting gameplay comes at the highest difficulty. There are 3 difficulties, easy, hard and master. Not all songs have all difficulties, and you need to unlock Master for every song individually, which you do by earning an S rank on Hard, which isn't as daunting as it sounds. 

The game does a great job at making all the notes make sense with the song, while at the same time mixing up the notes. So two verses in the song might sound identical, but play asymmetrically, and it's really interesting and fun.

The game played totally fine on both my xbox 360 controller, and my keyboard. On PC controls, all keys were rebindable, while on the controller the entire left side of the controller controls one note, while the entire right side controls the other note, which I appreciated.

There are scoreboards that drive you to better yourself everytime, and you can interestingly even sync up your save and scores with the mobile and PC version via online login.

I really appreciated all of the options they provide you with. One of them being an ""offset"" that you can use to try and perfect your audio sync with the visuals, in case your monitor screws with that.

Even more fun though, is unlocking new characters and elfins. All 3 characters have different stats that affect your scoring and playstyle, and they each have a bunch of costumes to unlock that each have their own unique and fun stats. Elfins are pets that just follow you in a level and give you passive buffs. 

You unlock all of this by simply playing the game and levelling up. This can be sped up by getting unique achievements per song, as well as daily tasks that refresh every 24 hours.

Unfortunately, that's also the only way to unlock new songs. At some point I reached a dead end and had to go back and replay old songs before I could unlock and play newer ones. I found that a bit frustrating. Although it didn't take too long, and I would have replayed old songs anyway, it still was a bit annoying.

The catchy music, great gameplay and charming aesthetic really made me fall in love with this game. A few more level designs would be great, as it can get a bit stale cycling through the same 4ish levels, but I'm hopeful they'll continue adding new content to the game following its launch, as they have in the past with the mobile version.

Overall, I highly recommend the game to rhythm-game fans, it's up there as one of my favourites now.",1561019661,1561019661,True,98,2,0.870682239532470703,9,False,False,False,False,,76561198028091020,5072,238,1145,0,508,1660052273

So I bought this for about 50 cents during this past summer sale because I am a huge fan of rhythm games and that was cheap af.
My only concern with buying it was that the DLC was way more expensive than the base game so I was expecting about an hour or two of game play with the rest stuck behind a paywall... lets be real for 50 cents that wouldn't be terrible.

Lets just say I was pleasantly surprised when I started playing the game and realized that there was hours and hours of fun content. The gameplay is fairly simple once you learn the controls but each level has an amazing song to it that I just love jamming to. Some levels are fairly difficult and I find myself having to replay levels to get the trophys as I am a completionist. The characters and elfins are a fun addition and overall there are so many cool things in this game.

Overall, this is one of my favourite rhythm games currently and even at the base price its WELL WORTH THE PRICE. But seriously, if you are looking for a fun game to spend time on but not be too overly invested in, you've found it!

I used to play it every evening when I was a teen and spent tons of hours playing it. When I stumbled across Muse Dash, I didn't expect a lot. In fact, I didn't even check which kind of music is in the game. I really liked the colorful art style, so I just bought it. The price was cheep anyway.

When I launched the game, I was kind of disappointed because I didn't expect the music to be... anime! I'm not a fan of such kind of music, but my husband is. So I though about refunding the game and buying a copy for him. I decided to give the game a try first, and I don't regret a thing. The game's so addictive and fun that I even got used to the music.

The game starts off very simple. You need to press two buttons—one to hit the enemies on the ground and the other to hit the enemies in the air. But don't be fooled 'cause the game's actually not that simple. There are obstacles that you'll need to avoid, enemies that become invisible, and even bosses. There's also Fever Mode that increases your score similar to Star Power in Guitar Hero. There are 3 difficulties: Easy, Hard and Master. Easy was too easy for me, so I quickly moved on to Hard and Master. Hard is available from the start. To unlock Master for a song, you have to complete that song with an S rank on Hard first. The rank in this game does not depend on your score like in Guitar Hero but on your accuracy, so you can't compensate lower accuracy with a higher score to get a higher rank. The difficulty increase with each song is very smooth, so you don't struggle with getting stuck on particular songs.

There's also a level system in the game. You gain experience when finishing songs, unlocking in-game achievements, and completing challenges. With each level you unlock a new song and get items needed to unlock new Muses and Elfins (small creatures that fly beside the Muse.) Each Muse and Elfin give bonuses, such as increasing Fever Mode time, boosting Muse's HP, increasing score, etc.

The base game contains about 50 songs. The DLC adds about 300 more songs and a few new characters. I will definitely purchase the DLC during a sale 'cause it adds a lot of content.
UPDATE: Got it, and it's definitely worth it!

If you don't mind the anime music, I recommend you this game. It's cheap, so you won't lose anything if you don't actually like it. If you do, you can purchase the DLC and add much more hours of play time to the game. Enjoy!

P.S. I believe that some people can get motion sick because of the game being a side-scroller that's moving fast enough. If you get motion sick, just take a break after each song. I also recommend focusing on the character rather than the moving objects. I've suffered from motion sickness myself when playing Melody's Escape (it's a side-scroller too), but after a while when I got used to the game, the motion sickness was gone.",1655488697,1676989334,True,80,1,0.865519344806671143,0,True,False,False,False,,76561198351096744,165,11,4241,0,719,1680296638

Now, they will be retiring the Just as Planned DLC on October 4th—a month from now,—which will be replaced by what they’re calling “Muse Plus,” [strike]a service that, as of now, we can’t be certain whether it’ll be a subscription-based service or a one-time purchase.[/strike] A one-time purchase DLC that’s virtually the same as the old Just as Planned DLC, with the sole exception that it doesn’t unlock certain song packs, which need to be bought separately.

That doesn’t seem too bad, right? They’re just changing the way the game manages microtransactions, and the ones that will be affected the most will be future players. If only the drama ended there…

The crux of the matter, the detail that made the player base explode in righteous anger is the second announcement, the one that said they would be releasing separate, larger-scaled “DLCs” that would not be unlocked for either legacy owners of Just as Planned or future owners of Muse Plus, which meant that both would need to buy those “DLCs” separately. If that isn’t a breach of their promise and a betrayal of trust, then what is it?

After a lot of criticism from the player base, the developers tried to make compromises. First, they announced that owners of Just as Planned could get the “DLCs” for free if they logged in on the first seven days following its release. Since that didn’t seem to do much to allay the players’ anger, they went back on their word, or perhaps further on their compromise, saying that Just as Planned users would be able to claim the “DLCs” for free anytime they went online for as long as it was on sale. They even tried to save face and make a joke out of it by saying:

[quote]We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you over the past few days. We will internally penalize the main person in charge of this update and urge them to reflect deeply.[/quote]
The full announcement can be found [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseDash/comments/167w489/announcement_update/]here[/url].

For old owners of Just as Planned, this would seem like a happy ending, in which they got back what they were first promised. Future players may even feel moved that the publisher had been magnanimous enough to listen to the players’ “feedback” on their decision, to the point of going back on it, but behind the curtains, this has been a victory for the publisher without a doubt. In the past three days, as this whole drama was unfolding, I imagine sales for Just as Planned must’ve gone up proportionally to the number of negative reviews it got, and following its retirement a month from now, they will continue to rise. If you’re reading this as a new player, I feel sorry for you, because now that you’re five years late, if you want to have access to all the songs, past and future, chances are, you will have to pay more than anyone that has been playing the game up to its fifth’s anniversary.

Convoluted announcements, betrayal of trust, and backtracking decisions. While gameplay is an important factor when choosing to buy a game, it’s just as important, if not more so, to consider the publisher’s relationship with its players, and this event has left a stain in their history. I’m sure that in time, as is often the case with most things, things will be forgotten, the negative reviews will stop, and everyone will go back to loving the game like a cuckold who chose to forgive their lover. Future players may never know their waifus were NTR’ing their players, but some of them were actually all right with that. “I bought Just as Planned for cheap many years ago and they have been giving us new updates for five years,” they would say as they gaze at their own navel, oblivious to the new players that had bought the (very expensive) Just as Planned DLC recently and were feeling slighted by the publishers. But to most of us, we will always remember the saying, “Trust goes out from the same door, from which the doubt comes in.” After all, trust takes many years to build, few seconds to break, and forever to repair.",1693676455,1700596545,False,797,28,0.863651633262634277,37,True,False,False,True,,76561198159173906,0,3,13679,0,4292,1713982321

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

They put a lot of effort into each and every update that they put out, all of that licensed music are expensive, and all the gorgeous art that they put into the game is AMAZING for a game that only costs like... 35 dollars... There are over 407 songs in this game for that price!! That's a value of 0.08 dollar PER SONG!! This is incredibly generous!! Not even mentioning the characters, elfins and all of the artwork that is in the game!

I honestly didn't even understand how they were making money being this generous with [Just As Planned], and I am glad that they are deciding to enforce a new way of monetizing their game, they deserve it!! but they had to backtrack on a lot of it due to review-bombing and boycotting.

From offering a special discount... to giving pervious owner of [Just As Planned] to own it forever if they claim it within a week... to just letting them have it forever if they had [Just As Planned] at all...

[h1]ADDITIONAL NOTE[/h1]
Muse Dash is a rhythm music game that combines action fighting and music in one genre. Each character will hit all opponents passes through away and they'll strike out by following rhythm of the song. There are many challenges that let your eyes felt almost giddy with its rhythm. 
The bossess will be shown when the song is in the middle or at the climax (basically called rep in middle of music). Easy to increase the EXP, get some stuffs and characters when you finishing a song. Price of the game is really cheap (Except DLC). Even my younger sister really likes the game.
She asked me to buy the Android version and I have bought the Android version. Your progress will be synchronized via Facebook and Google account. 
You can customize the keyboard as you wish, same as rhythm game in general. The game is really comfortable to played with low spec. Last but not least, you need to buy the DLC to unlock all songs.
And I'm very grateful to someone for giving me this game for free. Thank You~
[b][i]Fun Fact[/i][/b]: I always looking for their songs on Spotify and YouTube Music.

[h1]RECOMMEND ?[/h1]
Yes. People who like music definitely interested in rhythm music games.

105221231,english,"[b]This is a WARNING review about a major issue with this game which you should keep in mind if you are considering buying it.[/b]
Although the game is great when it works, the issue is - WHEN. The developers have made an update which added nothing new, but completely broke the game, making it unplayable for 3 weeks until they finally fixed it. Some of the major issues could've been fixed in a matter of minutes though. They didn't acknowledge any of the issues, there was no rollback of the update (so people could play while they were trying to fix it) and they didn't even apologize afterwards. There are still small residual bugs and the game is running worse than before the update, but it seems to work at least.
For a comparison - there was an update which (unintentionally) allowed all players to use characters from the DLC without the need to own it. It was fixed the very next day.
* So by buying this game you are risking that it may stop working after a random update and possibly won't be fixed for a long time.

[b]Details about the major issues in the aforementioned update[/b] (from my former review):
- The biggest issue being that some people can't play any levels. You get stuck on a purple screen with music in the background and must force close the game to get out. It isn't a one time issue either, if you are affected by this bug, you can't play, period.
* This was fixed after 3 weeks, but could've been done in a few minutes as only a few lines of code needed to be changed. The bug affected people whose OS uses commas instead of dots in decimal numbers.
- Another major issue which many if not all players can experience is that key presses aren't registering properly. This includes input drops on fast presses (several enemies very close together), random delays in inputs overall (up to several seconds), hits on some enemies straight up not registering, hits not registering for some time after ""hitting air"" (pressing key when there is no enemy to be hit), combos breaking after hitting a certain enemy in some levels... These issues make it hard/impossible to play harder levels properly, but also affect simple, slow levels.
* This was fixed after 2 or 3 weeks (based on other's comments, I was affected by the first bug and couldn't test it myself). The hit registration still sometimes feels wonky, so I am unsure if it is properly fixed or I just got rusty after being unable to play for so long. I have no idea what caused this bunch of bugs, but I would guess the developers just completely butchered the code trying to change/implement something.
- A last big issue being that the log in feature stopped working, which won't prevent you from playing the game, but is an inconvenience as your scores won't register into the leaderboards.
* This was fixed after 4 days, but could've been done in a few minutes as it was caused by devs changing the name of the folder which stores user data. Though some people still had issues even 2 weeks later.",1638630748,1641587509,False,93,2,0.832483410835266113,5,True,False,False,False,,76561198053743729,0,1,25523,37,17349,1715805827

53967830,english,"This game is actually good. Jumping into it, I did not really know what to expect from it but I ended up being very pleasantly surprised. The tutorial was quick and to the point, and while it doesn't exactly explain that you can use 2 keys for both ground and air, it does its job at explaining how the game works.

The characters, while few, have interesting variations that spice up the gameplay with their own unique abilities, suggestiveness not withstanding.

But if I could draw any parallels to this game, it would be Taiko no Tatsujin or osu!taiko if you're an osu! player. Believe me, if you've played either of those games (or both), jumping into this will be no problem. You'll make yourself right at home, especially if you're an osu!taiko player that plays with the kkdd scheme.

There are gripes with the game I have though, such as some songs rhythmically feeling like they don't really highlight what the player expects, leading to me just mashing for the most part and hope I get it right, but so far - it's been a blast.

In 3 hours I managed to reach Level 45 and unlock almost all of the free tracks but I will definitely come back to this in the future, either to finish unlocking everything or just to play for fun.

tl;dr
Do you want an anime-styled Taiko no Tatsujin for cheap? Muse Dash is for you!

[i](p.s. I was surprised how many songs I recognized here just by the fact that I played osu! before)[/i]

[b][u]HOWEVER[/u][/b] and I really must stress this point in particular - [b]the base game you buy is very lackluster.[/b] While you get a pretty alright selection of songs and enough content to keep you playing [i](the game even gives you a selection of free ""premium"" songs every week)[/i], this game's base content is really a far cry from what it could [i](and, arguably, should)[/i] be.

Muse Dash, in my opinion, should be a free to play game with the ""Just as Planned"" DLC being a premium upgrade option. Because if you want any reason to go back to this game at any point in the future, you will not find much reason to replay this without the ""Just as Planned"" DLC. Sure, you could go for character unlocks and gallery illustrations by leveling up, but as a rhythm game - the base game does feel lacking in a lot of areas and you will dry up all the content within 15 hours of playing. Sounds like a lot but in rhythm game terms - that's absolutely nothing.

So, take caution with this. If you're still not convinced otherwise by the big addendum I wrote there, then by all means - grab Muse Dash. It's a ton of fun and very accessible, especially to newbie rhythm game players.

But if you want any semblance of content and don't want to spend $30 on DLC to get more songs, then avoid Muse Dash and look for an alternative game to play, one of which I already mentioned in this very review.",1562605723,1672068492,True,45,1,0.830798685550689697,1,True,False,False,False,,76561198102063164,560,71,569,0,187,1670098296

[h1]Keep It Simple Rhythm Game That Just Works[/h1]
Muse Dash offers a cute and vibrant art style to go along with a simple and addicting two button style gameplay. The game has three base characters to choose from that you will unlock costumes and companions for in a token style system as you play. During songs you have to hit and avoid things on either the top or bottom plane as you continually run. There are three difficulties you can choose from for most songs allowing for you to enjoy regardless of your skill. There is a fair amount of varied content content in the songs and as you can probably tell from the store page where this game really shines is it's cutesy design and vibrant color scheme. 

[h1]The Minor Gripes[/h1]
Honestly the only gripe I have isn't anything major or deserved. There is a lot of content locked behind a paywall. At first it was 20 songs you would unlock if you bought it from what I remember seeing but there are even more songs added now. I've read how some would prefer to have a steam workshop but it may be hard to keep the charm and design over custom added songs.

+Cute Art
+Simple Addicting Gameplay
+Vibrant Colors
+Nice Soundtrack Variety

[h1](っ>▬<)っ x cons x[/h1]
-DLC seems pricey
[/code]

The dlc price is a bit steep but it's probably worth if you enjoy the game and they keep cranking out content. Just clearing the base content of this game took me around four hours and I'll probably go back to it every once in a while. I hope to be able to pick up the dlc one day and experience everything this game has to offer and I hope they continue to add more content. For now if you enjoy rhythm games; I can easily recommend Muse Dash for the base price seeing the great content you get.

The game offers a killer selection of songs across various genres, from pop to rock to electronic beats. Plus, it's packed with tons of characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities and style. Customizing your experience with different characters and unlocking new songs adds a layer of replay value! It's an absolute must-play, no joke!

Leaving my child behind

Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind

With all this anger, guilt and sadness

Coming to haunt me forever

I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river

Is this revenge I am seeking?

Or seeking someone to avenge me?

Stuck in my own paradox, I wanna set myself free

Maybe I should chase and find

Before they'll try to stop it

It won't be long before I'll become a puppet

It's been so long

Since I last have seen my son lost to this monster

To the man behind the slaughter

Since you've been gone

I've been singing this stupid song so I could ponder

The sanity of your mother

I wish I lived in the present

With the gift of my past mistakes

But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes

Your sweet little eyes, your little smile is all I remember

Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper

Justification is killing me

But killing isn't justified

What happened to my son? I'm terrified

It lingers in my mind

And the thought keeps on getting bigger

I'm sorry my sweet baby, I wish I've been there

[b] Don't let the ecchi/anime aesthetic turn you off. [/b] If you can, there's a lovely game hidden underneath the blatant sex appeal.

 + Great core 2-button (really works out to 5 or 7) gameplay
 + EXCELLENT, Professional-quality charts, excellent consistency across charters 
[i] shoutout to Howard_Y the GOAT [/i]
 + BANGERS ONLY: Real talk, this game's soundtrack is BUMPIN. If you have an interest in rhythm games, odds are pretty good this game can help you find some new artists at minimum and new favourites at best.
[i] Okimochi Expression my beloved [/i]
 + Lots of amazing collab song packs and gimmick charts for the enthusiasts out there.

Once you've caught on to how to play accurately (i.e. consistently >90%), the game really opens up in its variety. The different characters (called Muses) and pets (Elfins) allow you to tailor your goals and experience per-song.
Of particular note is the ""Devil Combo"" of Little Devil Marija combined with the Elfin Lilith.
This particular combo takes this generally casual rhythm game and makes every single hit count.
It has made easily the most tense rhythm gaming experiences of my life despite it being by far one of my least-played rhythm games by time spent. (also played: Osu, SDVX, IIDX, DJMAX, Project DIVA)

I haven't even mentioned the best part yet. You buy it on Steam once and get the Just as Planned DLC once, you get any new/upcoming song packs for free. It's seriously rare to see a rhythm game have that much faith in their content that they'll take your money only once (twice if you get just the base game first but honestly it isn't representative of the game with the DLC).

All in all, the best money I've ever spent on a rhythm game ever and it's nowhere near done.

+ Music tends to go along the aesthetics of the game. It is energetic, classy and dynamic.
+ There is a good number of mobs to crush, from enemies having different models to bosses.
+ The game price is relatively low for the quality it presents. Characters have animations and are rich in detail.
+ The sound effects are not an extra or queue for notes, instead, they complement the songs in the game.
+ Lots of replayability with DLC songs. Some of them are free rewards once the player reaches a certain level.

- The game starts very easy, which can be boring for some players.
- Leaderboard requires a sign in into your google account in order to post your score.
- Since the game is flashy and features vivid colors, playing on a room that it is not bright enough can be a bother.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Muse Dash is a hybrid-rhythm game that successfully combines the elements of side-scroller with the fast-paced beats of a music game. It also features a lot of quality when it comes to details in its final product, as characters have their own animations and look. Enemies do as well, as the variety of mobs and bosses add a rich layer to the game as well as a vibe that goes between comedy and cuteness. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

In Muse Dash, players must hit musical beats which are featured as a sort of elements. These can range from robots to lollipops or starts. As they beat these notes, hazardous elements such as enemies traps or bosses that will spawn to obstruct the player progress and eventually create a sort of mini showdown after which they will retire. Early levels start off easy as a sort of practice mode, while later ones can be hard to beat on higher difficulties. 

There are three characters in the game, these are Rin, Buro, and Marija. Each of these characters has different costumes that each possess their own effects and will affect gameplay. For example, default Marija will make it so that when a combo is under 100, missing a note won't break the combo while default Buro becomes invincible during fever mode. These can be stacked with Elfin effects. Elfins are little creatures that will help the players by giving them more fever time, reducing damage and more.

Fever mode is activated when the player fills up the fever gauge. This can be done quickly by successfully maintaining a combo. While in fever mode, notes give more score and the visuals change to reflect an even more energetic style. Fever mode can also be used to recover some health if enemies with hearts show up.

Songs have a number below them in each difficulty. This number indicates how hard it is to beat the song on the said setting. The first songs are extremely easy, even on hard which will result in lots of full combos(perfects). However, once the player reaches lv 25-30, songs will start to become more challenging, especially on master difficulty. So, for those of you who enjoy those insane notes being stacked together, don't worry, they are in the game.


[h1] Color is the Key [/h1]


What makes Muse Dash so singular is that it really goes out of its way with the aesthetics. Every element seems to complement each other rather than being the result of an addition. The characters are flashy, the enemies have lots of models featuring cute and fun themes, the songs are energetic, the visuals are vivid and the bosses show-up in style. It is like watching the game put on a show while playing it.

Every detail is executed with the utmost cared. From Buro's facial expressions when she hits notes to costumes and sound. The songs are fast paced but the rhythm is always present and new enemies keep getting added as the player progresses through the song list. This quality resembles a certain extent, that of a AAA game.

I would recommend players to play on hard mode, and then move to master. This way there is a learning curve of sorts for each song, while also adding some complexity to the gameplay. It can be sort of boring at first, but it gets much better later in the game.

There are also multiple stages, from cities filled with robotic enemies to candy islands filled with pink palettes to a factory in space. The stages are a nice touch and they can keep the game from getting repetitive, as having the same background for all songs would be detrimental. The enemy models can vary in the same stage, this means that sometimes you can see certain types of enemies while in another song the mobs will be different, even if the stage is the same one.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs like butter. Most systems should be getting 100-200 frames with ease. Muse Dash is a game that can be both fun and entertaining to watch, and you are getting much more than your money's worth with the quality present here. The only thing I didn't like so much is that rather than featuring its own leaderboard, it borrows it from google which might look a little cheap.

[h1] What Makes It Special [/h1]

What makes this game special is that it does manage to keep the player attention after multiple sessions. Usually, a rhythm game will be bought and eventually forgotten, but Muse Dash makes the player come back to it whenever it is because of the side-scroller elements, it’s aesthetics or the characters commenting on the main menu. It is a rhythm game that tries to soar among its peers by adding lots of little details.

What also makes this special is how fun it is. Smacking enemies to the rhythm of a song can be great for casual fun and some enjoyment. At the same time, getting that full combo or aiming for a place in the scoreboard can be challenging, this invites the player to revisit songs they had already cleared, and with the mixes of its elements, it becomes something to look forward rather than a task.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Muse Dash is a fantastic game that features lots of elements, mixes them together and keeps elevating them. Its strongest point is it’s a presentation, everything looks nice and rich in detail. The song list is pretty good and it's always funny to see how the characters speak to the player on screen. This is a game that was put effort into it, and it was worth to do so based on the attention it has been getting. I recommend this to all players who want to try a rhythm game but don't feel too sure and to everyone who enjoys this kind of games.

51452471,english,"TL;DR: The game plays out well, and the music is addicting. Characters, costumes, Elfins, and songs will continue to be put out for this game, which is really neat. For people who are still on the edge for buying the DLC songs, I am almost 100% sure that when they release new song packs, those songs will be included in the DLC; It sort of acts as a Season Pass. Absolutely get this game, and if you can afford it, get the DLC as well.

This game is a total blast to play. People may turn away from it's simplistic controls and it's limited 2 lane mechanics, but the feeling of nailing a combo and popping that Fever at just the right time is just amazing. And the characters you play also add up to that experience, with each of them having unique animations for their personalities.

The characters that they introduce are not only cute, but each costume that they get have certain abilities, such as increased Fever bar gain, or more health per pick-up. There is even a costume that lets you watch a perfect run of the song. There are also Elfins, little pets that you can bring during your song in order to give you another special ability to use.
The only downside to this, is the way you obtain these characters and Elfins. You start off with one character and no Elfins, and as you level up, you collect items that will unlock a specific character/Elfin. Each character/Elfin needs 8 specific items to be obtained. This can become a grind, and after a while, you'll be replaying the songs you can do in order to gain the exp to level up. But you can see this as a positive too; at least they didn't hide any of the characters behind a paywall. (At least, from when I'm posting this.)

The songs are very mixed, actually. Some are vocaloid, some are instrumental, and some are just regularly sung songs in Japanese or Chinese. These are actually pretty nice songs, and fit perfectly with the type of game this is. In the base game, they start off easy, and continually become harder and harder to complete, which helps players visualise their progress in something more than just unlocking songs.

Unlocking songs works kind of in the same way that unlocking characters does, but instead of having to obtain items, it is directly linked to your level. Songs are unlocked each level until a point, then are unlocked every two levels. (Final one is an exception, needing 5 more levels after the previous song.) I only had to replay a song once or twice in order to unlock a few of the songs, which was nice. But the variety in songs gave me enough experience in order to expand my knowledge on this games mechanics.

All in all, a very solid game, worthy of its praise so far. Keep up the good work guys.",1561505519,1561505519,True,41,2,0.800673723220825195,0,True,False,False,False,,76561198123713690,327,6,6946,0,588,1709335555

107244746,english,"TLDR: 8/10

---{ Graphics }---
☐ You forget what reality is
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

Super cute art style, the colors and general vibe of the art as a whole makes me very happy, but I'm also biased considering I have a sanrio hyperfixation lmao. Overall very good art, different maps occasionally have different styles too, and they're all very cute and unique.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

Very fun gameplay, the leveling system motivates you to play for longer so you can get little items you use to unlock new characters. 

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

Super good music, I even recognize a few of the artists of songs here. Not all of the music is cutesy upbeat stuff or vocaloid, if that's not really your thing. It's definitely a lot of them, but there's also some very good instrumental tracks!

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

Despite everything I have said, the fact I'm gay is probably the only thing keeping me from looking incredibly suspicious picking at least half of the character options

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☑ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

My judgement of computer requirements is absolutely horrid, so take this with a grain of salt. No really, I have to check task manager for each new game I play because I always somehow think I can max out the graphics settings and then wonder why my PC is begging for mercy.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

Very simple controls, just hit f and j (or also d and k if you're playing a faster song) It can get a bit more complex when you get to harder difficulty songs, but since the controls are so easy to remember it's pretty easy to find yourself getting better at that one song you were having trouble with.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second live for grinding

Pretty self explanatory. You level up after playing 1-2 songs so getting new characters isn't much of a grind.

---{ Story }---
☑ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

I just say long because there isn't really a set end to the game, it's really just play until you get bored.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

The price for the base game is 100% worth it, just wanna clarify. The DLC I'd only really get if it's on sale, there's already plenty of songs in the base game to occupy you for quite a while. But if you really want more songs, the DLC definitely seems to be worth it considering it's really just a ""buy once, get all of the songs + DLC is updated with new songs you just get if you've already purchased it"" sorta deal. There aren't dozens of song packs to sort through that start to add up.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

I haven't encountered any bugs, but I'm sure there have been tiny ones. Nothing game breaking or that aren't fixable, though.

---{ ? / 10 }---

☐ 4
☐ 5
☐ 6
☐ 7
☑ 8
☐ 9
☐ 10

Don't let the fact I only have 2 hours of playtime fool you, my attention span just is that of a fly. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who's into rhythm games, or wants to get into rhythm games but is overwhelmed by how complex they can get. It's very simple and really good for someone who's just starting out.

I can wholeheartedly say this is a good one, a great one even. From the very beginning it just felt GOOD to play it. Inputs are tight, responsive. Feels amazing. Playing and succeeding is extremely satisfying. Song choice is also very good with a nice variety(you will get dubstep, funkot, generic edm, eurobeat, poppy vocaloid songs and more). If you are a fan of rhythm games- this one is a must. Very fun and addictive. If you are a veteran used to playing the highest difficulty in your music games don't expect too much of a challenge though, you will probably unlock all the songs in about 5 hours of game play like I did. But you can always get DLC for many other great songs which I definitely recommend. You may find the DLC price a bit high but I would say it's worth every penny since the song library is absolutely massive.

This game is the real deal. A supremely satisfying rhythm game for beginners and veterans alike, with tight controls, good song selection, and great art and sound design.

If you're interested, get it. It's $3 and you'll know long before the 2-hour refund window whether it's something you'll want to keep (Spoiler alert: you will). There are plenty of songs to enjoy even without the DLC, and the game isn't predatory with its unlocks. Anything that's unlockable via level-up, I acquired just by playing and enjoying the game, without feeling pressured to buy the DLC for its XP boost. At the time of this review, I've played for 17 hours on the cheap version, and I'm thrilled to be buying the DLC purely for the love of the game, and not because I felt like I needed it to enjoy the base content fully.

159111707,english,"The non-recommendation is more to highlight the buyer beware aspect of this review for late adopters of DLC content.  Do recommend Muse game on sale.   Understand DLC can no longer be all grabbed in an all in one DLC package via steam purchase anymore.  Have to go through the in game store.  Yes they have Muse Plus which gets you everything released up to October 2023, but after that is all [i]purely[/i] in game store.  Most of those usually run $8.99 each, so the price hike for those that don't catch the train does ride high for missing the train.   Are they worth it?  The assistance is worth it for learning players and the tracks themselves come with fun unique visuals and are crossover characters so licensing fees.

If you already got Just As Planned, Muse Dash has already grandfathered you in and you're riding good as long as you stay active during first week releases of DLC updates.  Otherwise, you'll be in the same $8.99 train as non-owners of Just As Planned.


[h3]Muse Dash Rundown[/h3]
Simple musical rhythm game with fun graphics (Only 2 buttons)
Prompt directions, visibility, and pace of what to grab or avoid is how difficulty gets adjusted between charts. 

Content is absolutely geared towards teenagers and young adults with a taste for the upbeat aspect of Japanese & Chinese popular music culture.
Shows signs of being designed for Mobile devices and Nintendo Switch first but added in good convenience options for PC version, including controller support.
Large, mostly upbeat music selection
Crossover content open for unlimited time frame 
Popular songs do get special chart effects and visuals
Original and crossover characters with various boosts and gameplay modifiers with the ability to shut off their modifies with a helper if you just want a skin swap.
Newer players will eat DLC price hike that early adopters will not have to.
As of review, still being updated with more songs after 6 years both free and DLC, with a mixture of crossover and original songs.
Many Easter Eggs and hidden charts, from Touhou to Cytus 2.  Knowledge of what happens in those games may prove useful to unlocking those secerts without guides.


[h3]In speaking of Easter Eggs[/h3]
For those who want to understand why Muse Dash is still special despite it's simple concept
[spoiler]Bad Apple has special visuals on their chart[/spoiler]
[spoiler]the nyan cat song is best enjoyed after mastering the default songs[/spoiler]
[spoiler]If you're familar with the hellohell animated music video, the chart visual fade effects match pretty close despite there was no need to do so without affecting game play.[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Cytus 2 has their most famous song of their lore be given dual treatment of played straight and for those of us who know when the song played in the story, can find and play a special chart with unique visuals as well[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Default songs from level 55 onwards will play around with player expectations for unique challenges[/spoiler]

TL;DR
The chart designers didn't have to go those extra miles and this is by no means an exhaustive list, but if you know the pop or meme culture behind a song, the care the chart designers add to each song shows through the visuals.  Some of them hidden through repeat clicking difficulty before starting a song.


[h3]General Vibe Of Music Runner[/h3]
Muse Dash is the simple one to just pick up and get back into.
Good mood booster.
Mixed feelings on the management change but their handling of newer Muse Characters and their bonuses (i.e Rin and Len helping players doing duo notes & hold notes hit off hand prompts easier) aimed to be reaching out to both add in popular music based icons into the game that also help players still learning advanced difficult chart patterns, while not overshadowing challenge characters that reward higher skilled players who like to curse less than perfect game play for score boosts. 
[spoiler]i.e. Little Devil Marija, who only really works for already fast paced charts, otherwise she straight up offs herself in under 30 seconds due to her HP drain.[/spoiler]

If the Japanese and Chinese heavy song rooster isn't your thing, try out DJMax.  It's a significantly more PC based title with a massive collection of charts and many more English songs to rock out to.  Funny enough Muse Dash collabed with DJMax Respect V as well and Rin is a pretty good collab character for those who dislike timing fading prompts.   Or just stick to Beat Saber.

 [h3]About the reviewer[/h3]
Old Rockband 3 and Dance Dance Revolution fan who has been seeking out various music games ever since former musical rhythm titles faded from prevalence.   Disappeared off Steam for several years when titles like Arcaea, Deemo, Cytus 2, Lanota, and Beat Saber played better on non-PC attached devices.  Has returned and rediscovered some old loves to PC titles and the re-emerging market for well done musical games on PC.   Though the dream of some good music rhythm co-op games still drives the hunt for other titles.",1708743587,1708751226,False,46,3,0.780914604663848877,6,True,False,False,True,,76561198090886734,0,6,794,0,427,1714275157

113182704,english,"YES! THERE ARE SONGS FEATURING HATSUNE MIKU IN THIS GAME! With that out of the way, let me tell you that Muse Dash is just a straight up good time. It's chock-full of the sort of uwu and uguu anime and vocaloid type beat vibes that I absolutely adore, but I don't think you gotta be a full-on weeb to vibe along and give your fingers a real workout here. Muse Dash is a HELLA cutesy rhythm game with lots of HECKIN' cute (and valid) music for you and your perhaps soon-to-be waifus to mash, bash, and Dash your way through together. The soundtrack has a pretty good mix of genres and moods, but leans mostly towards poppy and up-beat, with predominantly clean production and a generally electronic sound. There are only a few guitar-forward/rock tracks. No black metal tracks, sorry. Most of the vocals are sung in Japanese and Chinese, but there's some English and Korean as well.

The game's control scheme and overall premise is very simple. Notes travel down two rows, from right to left, and you're tasked with smashing them before they leave the screen, while also avoiding obstacles! You have an UP attack/jump for hitting notes in the top row and jumping over obstacles in the bottom row, a DOWN attack/dive for hitting notes in the bottom row and diving under obstacles in the top row, and an optionally manual ""Fever Mode"" activation function. By default, Fever Mode is activated automatically when the Fever Gauge becomes full. Fever Mode in Muse Dash works much like Star Power in Guitar Hero; hit notes, bar go up, use for bonus points + fancy effects. Wait, did I call them notes? I meant happy little clouds with bunny ears, visibly shy ghosts, samurai things, lollipops, cowboy(???) blob creatures riding seemingly rocket-propelled ice cream cones, grumpy cotton candy, HAMMERS (bonk), and... Smash and Dash 'em all! I will continue to call them notes from now on. If your chosen character gets hit by something, she cries a bit and takes damage, and if you fail a stage because she got hit a lot, she'll cry a lot. You don't want to make her cry. 

Muse Dash is a game about playing a beat on your vidya manipulation device of choice in time with music, and not usually in correspondence to one particular instrument in a song, but several, including vocals! So you might go BAP BAP BAP BAPBAPBAP on your keyboard to a song's vocals, and then... BARABARABAPBAP -- you just BAP-ed along to a drum fill, on the same song! After finishing a song, you'll be given a letter ranking based on how accurately you played it, and a score based on STUFF. A note can be missed entirely, which counts as a MISS. It can be hit sort of on time, which counts as a GREAT hit. And it can be hit basically perfectly on time, which counts as a PERFECT hit. Going all brrrr on your keyboard and seeing ""PERFECT"" after ""PERFECT"" on the screen with every note hit is super satisfying. You need to hit all notes PERFECT-ly and not get hit by any obstacles to get 100% accuracy and the Gold S ranking on a song. If you use your mouse to click anywhere (except there) on the victory screen after finishing a song, you'll get a slightly more detailed rundown of how accurate you were. Hitting MOST notes in a song is often very easy, but hitting most of them perfectly is considerably more difficult, and hitting ALL OF THEM perfectly is just oof. There are also, like, just musical notes that u can run into and stuff... Ye. YEEHH, you get it. Notes come and notes go, and your mission in Muse Dash is to hit notes in time with the music.

Joining you and your waifus on your merry dashing and bashing are the Elfins. Elfins are these little creatures that fly beside the girls and give them various buffs. The different girls have different abilities too, but to be honest, which girl and Elfin you decide to use isn't all that important unless you're looking to absolutely maximize your score and climb the leaderboards. I personally care more about accuracy than score so I just play with pretty much whoever, although I've definitely developed a fondness for Marija Magical Girl... :L *bonk* They all function pretty similarly for the most part, but a few definitely stand out. Like Reimu from Touhou, for example, who can hover, and who is from Touhou! Touhou btw! And Sleepwalker Girl Rin, who will just straight up play through any track automatically, which is helpful if you wish to study a difficult track without dying constantly. 

There are differently themed stages with different looking notes/enemies for you to Dash through. A jazzy song might have you Dash through a city on a rainy night, smashing top hats and missiles, because obviously. Whereas a more cutesy/sweet song will send you straight to diabetes heaven... <.< ... >.> ... It's also rumored that sometimes, on some songs, a stage might-- All of the different stages look great. It can take a teeny-tiny bit of time to get used to playing on an unfamiliar stage just because everything looks so different, but the core mechanics of mashing and dashing are the same between them all.

As of writing, there are 352 songs in the game, about 60 of which (I think) are included with the base game. The ""Just as planned"" DLC grants you access to all songs currently in the game + all songs added in the future, in addition to giving you a permanent 1.5x EXP boost and unlocking all girls (which I think the developers refer to as ""Beauties"", by the way :0) and Elfins immediately. A few DLC songs are made available to those with only the base game each week, for a limited time. The base game's ""Default"" songs (which doesn't include all the base game songs) are unlocked by leveling up -- they are NOT unlocked by the DLC. You earn EXP and level up by playing through songs. After you've unlocked all the Default songs I don't know what the heck your level even does. Mine's over 600 as of writing, which... Ok. If you like to watch number go the very big one, then wahoo mamma mia for you, I guess -- that number do be going up up up. I suppose there are the unlockable illustrations (and unlockable girls if you don't have the DLC unlock them for you), but they aren't gated behind specific levels like the Default songs are... It's a whole big thing. The illustrations all look very nice and can be viewed in the menu at any time, and they can be saved to your hard drive as .png's as well. Well, the animated ones can't be, but- WHATEVER! Unlocked illustrations can be seen on the loading screens as well. For like three full seconds. Stuff's cool and good, really.

Muse Dash is very straightforward. Hop in, play the tutorial, and BAM! You're off! It's got a wonderful, playful vibe to it. I don't have many complaints with it. I'm tempted to call it PERFECT. I suppose I wish there were more difficulty options for some songs. Because sometimes I find a song that I really like to listen to, but that I don't really like to play because I find it too easy. Ah well. Muse Dash is a very solid game, and a must-play for fans of rhythm games. Even those who have never played a rhythm game before should give it a shot. It's very easy to get a basic hang of, and the base game is cheap as heck anyway. If you end up liking it a lot, the DLC is definitely worth your money as well.",1648845156,1648895055,True,38,1,0.762704014778137207,3,False,False,False,False,,76561198049001305,0,2,5308,0,3181,1708899717

I actually knew of Muse Dash before it had a release date on Steam. I vaguely remember coming across it one day and seeing gifs of two characters (which I now know is Maid Marija and Sleepwalker Rin). However, I never actually picked it up till the last winter sale. I guess I never added it to my wishlist and thus never got a notification that it released. Fast forward after I played through Deemo Reborn (as well as still playing Deemo and VOEZ), here I am trying to shake off my obsession with another rhythm game. I saw that this was just $3 and said why not. If I didn’t end up liking it, it wouldn’t be too much money down the drain.

Muse Dash is a colorful two lane rhythm game that has you fight enemies (or projectiles) to the beat of the music instead of simply hitting the notes. Taking a side-scroller approach, your enemies come in from the right and will either be at ground level or up in the air (which makes up the lanes). A song can take place on either of the four maps, with most enemies getting a reskin and containing their own boss. Though, the variety you’ll come across enemy-wise doesn’t stop at what lane they’re in. There’s the classic small and big enemies, enemies that are linked together called Gemini that take up both lanes, ghosts that disappear a few seconds before it hits your crossfire, and bosses. There are also the more annoying Raiders variant that is basically an enemy swooping in at the last second. Bosses in particular will send out more enemies, fire projectiles where you have to resist your urge to dodge them, or even come at you, but you can’t necessarily defeat them. Though, the map’s boss and a particular big enemy with an exclamation mark will let you mash away and there are hold notes (Sheets) here as well.

Other than enemies, there are also hammers that can swing down, saws that you need to jump over or you get hurt and your combo is broken, song notes that increases your score and hearts to increase your health.

As of now, the base game has 48 songs available with 100+ songs with the Just as Planned DLC (with more songs coming in every month). In addition, Muse Dash also has a weekly free song rotation for anyone without the DLC so you can get more of a taste on what the DLC will give you other than listening to the song previews.

There are 3 characters, or muses, that you can play as with their own unique outfits. Each different outfit will give you a specific ability that can help you out, whether it be giving you more health or increasing your score. There are also Elfins that can join you and provide you with their ability. If you happen to get hurt a lot or want to get a full combo more easily, you can equip an Elfin with an ability that can help. Although, these aren’t unlocked automatically. On every level up, you’ll be randomly given two chips that will either be for an Elfin, a character skin, or a photo for loading screens. Elfins and characters require eight while photos only need five.

You can gain EXP from completing songs (the higher score you have the more EXP you get), achievements, daily challenges, and song specific challenges (which can range from getting a minimum combo or perfectly hitting certain enemies). Idol Buro also gives you more EXP when you play as her.

Muse Dash is definitely worth picking up for $3. Before I picked up the Just as Planned DLC, I played for 5 hours and still needed to unlock one more song. Of course, those who want to score on all difficulties and perfect all songs will have a longer playtime. You probably should look up some songs so you know if you’ll enjoy the music here, but considering how cheap it is for the base game, it couldn’t hurt to try it out anyway.

152270454,english,"This game has been some of the most fun I have ever had with a rhythm game. It would be an easy recommendation if not for the current state of the dlc. I was lucky enough to get into the game before just as planned was retired, about 2-3 years.

For context, Peropero had a dlc for their game, ""Just as Planned +"" which promised there would be no need to pay for future updates, an absolute steal. This dlc and its promise was made before Muse Dash blew up considerably, and my guess for why they decided to try and go back on it, is because it just isn't sustainable. Muse Dash is cheap, and Just as Planned + was still a good price for getting literally every new song pack for free even with the price increases. I actually was okay with this change, it felt fair. Not many in the community felt the same, and I don't blame them. PeroPero attempted to compromise with several announcements, which just made people angrier. Paired with some other controversies in the past, and you have a company that has broken the trust it's built with its community in its attempts to create a more sustainable model.

I'm not defending PeroPero here, either, there was other ways to go about making more money without obliterating the trust of their fans.

As it stands now, Just as Planned + users will continue getting all content packs for free, while newer players get a much worse deal. If you chose to buy this game now, you would have to pay more than the people that got here before the 5th anniversary. As much as I love this game, I cannot genuinely recommend it to a new player unless they're willing to put up with the fact they have to spend more than veterans just to unlock the same content.

That aside, the game itself is incredibly fun. It's a 2k rhythm game with waifus, and some really fun charts among its many content packs.

92915020,english,"Muse Dash is a rhythm game featuring a very pretty anime anesthetic. Its music collection is mostly electronic music, with heavily auto-tuned vocal if there is any. As a fan of acoustic, they are not my type, but they are not bad to listen to. I think anime music lovers are likely to appreciate its collection. 

Besides the music taste, this game is solid and fun. It has a structured progression system to unlock content such as music, characters and skins so that you don’t get bored easily. It is also very easy to get the hang of, however, for controller users, the game fails to show the control scheme correctly. In the tutorial, it shows a play icon for air attack. Actually, all buttons (including moving sticks) on the left side are for the air while all on the right side are for the ground (excluding select and menu buttons). I appreciate the game gives freedom to players to use any button they desire, but what is that play icon suppose to mean? Please fix it.

This is my first time playing this genre, so I don’t know if this is a thing for rhythm games not following the beats sometimes, to be more hectic and unpredictable. It doesn’t feel right to me as the sudden change of not following beats can throw me off. Also, some songs have less audible beats, making these songs more difficult to play, not in a fun way.

Anyway, for those who are into this genre, especially for people like electronic music and anime, this game is a treat. As for those who haven’t play any rhythm game, you can get it a shot. It is cheap, easy to get into, and its music collection is constantly getting updated.

Politics don't belong to videogames and abusive companies like this should go bankrupt: save your money for someone more deserving, instead.

The game, the little I played, was fine an fun. The problem is that it has only 52 songs, of which you might like not the entirety, this implies that you're forced to buy the DLC if you want a bit of variety and more songs to play. If only it had a music analyzer like Audiosurf or Beat Hazard!

A very casual and catchy visual music game where you can defeat various enemies from the air and ground, avoid gears, collect notes and hearts to complete the music.

[code]- A decent number of song are included even by default, but the number of song will increase with the purchase of the DLC. There are regular updates and collaborations with others, so if you only have DLC, you can play for a long time.

- Characters not only change their appearance, but also have their own characteristics, so it's nice to have the option to change the character that suits your playstyle as needed or just use the character you like.[/code]

Girls are cute, songs are catchy, if you're a fan of Vocaloid, and J-pop and C-pop you'll probably find a few songs on there that you'll enjoy. Pretty easy to pick up and play, especially for a novice at rhythm games, but can be hard to master especially with the higher difficulties.

Pros:
Cheap (DLC is $30, far more than the game, but for the amount of new songs you get, it's probably worth it)
Addicting
Cute girls
Catchy songs
Small download, and isn't too demanding on slower machines (I play on both my gaming desktop and my microsoft surface go)

Things to be aware of:
Some of the character skins are considered NSFW (however I don't think there is any nudity) so I wouldn't recommend this game for someone under the age of 13, use your judgement if your kid asks for it, look at the character skins before deciding if it's right to let a someone under 18 play.",1585197711,1621320303,True,24,0,0.731897890567779541,1,True,False,False,False,,76561198095952706,0,3,1930,0,354,1704903978

‣ The base game currently has 46 songs and they keep adding to that list over time. Most of these songs are locked until you level up which happens pretty quickly, and gives you have something to work towards. Random DLC songs will be free to play for limited times if you haven't bought the DLC too!
‣ The gameplay looks really simple (and might even look a bit boring) but it's a lot more fun and satisfying than it looks, and it can become pretty challenging to get Full Combos and high percentages on songs with higher difficulties.
‣ There are 3 different characters with several costumes each, but the game divides them as 15 individual characters with their own unique abilities. There are also pets called ""Elfins"" that have their own useful abilities.
‣ The music is really great, although that is purely based on opinion, but the genres are decently diverse so I'm sure there are some good tracks for just about any rhythm game players.


Muse Dash really exceeded my expectations for it's price, and the DLC expands the game a lot! You just pay for it once and you get all the current music, plus they just keep adding tracks to it over time.

Writing this review out of sheer impulse due to the amusement I've had. Easily, should be a blind purchase for anyone that has taken even the slightest of fascination to it. You simply can't go wrong with this.

First minute in and I'm absolutely captivated by the cutesy and vibrant aesthetic that the game offers. In another few moments, saw myself completely engrossed, losing track of time whilst being exposed to some underrated melodies and tracks that profusely appeal to the masses of the weaboo popculture, such as of course, myself. :3

Muse Dash consists of 3 lovely playable characters with unlockable costumes that are most meticulously fashioned, each with distinctive in-game animations and quirks.  
40 tracks are in the base game with an optional addition of 13 music packs that has 6 songs/each pack. Upon the purchase of the DLC, the players will receive 1 pack each month completely for free.

It comprises of two button inputs, now while that may sound quite elementary, underestimated must it be not due to the articulation it has that makes up for a euphoric experience, for indeed inside this brightly lit shell conceals within an engaging rhythmic venture.

Originally, Muse Dash is a mobile game available on iOS / Android, this PC port is polished and faithful to its counterparts with higher resolutions and an unlocked frame-rate for fluidity and pure eye candy bliss. 

For a rhythm genre enthusiast, it would pose as rather underwhelming however fortunately, there is a higher ""Master"" difficulty unlocked, that cranks things up a notch for a bit of a challenge, but can as well be surmounted with practice. 

With such a colorfully charming appeal, ebullient design, ecstatic gameplay at a bang for the buck of a price, Muse Dash makes an excellent candidate for gifting to fellow  ̶w̶e̶e̶b̶s̶ friends. 
Observed some of my own pals playing after being gifted, going at it relentlessly that automatically serves as a compliment to the product.

ㅤㅤㅤ𝗗𝗜𝗦𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗜𝗠𝗘𝗥: while the base game is fairly cheap and you can eventually unlock almost all songs and characters simply by playing, do note that there is a DLC called [b]Just as planned[/b] that gives you access to pretty much [i]everything[/i]. It's quite a bit pricier, but it's real value for money – the game is updated regularly and new music is added all the time. Never regretted getting it.

ㅤㅤㅤSo, what does one see when they launch Muse Dash? The first thing would inevitably be the logos of the developer and the publisher, stylised to include crudely-drawn butts and breasts. Then, a flash – and a sexualised anime girl appears on the title screen! Or maybe all three of them. And then it just never stops: the innuendos, the double entendres, the scantily-clad ladies and the moans. This is probably where the backseating potential goes down the drain; one might even go as far as to say that this game exudes a [i]severe[/i] lack of female companionship. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827343248
ㅤㅤㅤHowever, all of that is surface-level stuff – a superficial veneer of eye-candy fan service; for those who are able to look past it, Muse Dash will reveal its [strike]tight body[/strike] true nature – an easy-to-learn, yet tough-to-master rhythm game that, despite its simplistic mechanics, can put your abilities to a real test. 

ㅤㅤㅤThere are only two lines of notes – on the ground and in the air. Some notes will be invisible, some of them you'll need to hold, and some will require you to mash all buttons as fast as possible. There are also spinning gears you need to jump over, hammers that you must hit and Gemini enemies – those that make you hit both ground and air buttons at the same time. To top it all off, each song has a 'stage boss' that barrages you with notes in a less predictable fashion or at a faster pace. That's... everything there is to it. However, when it all comes together, you will see just how crazy it can get.

ㅤㅤㅤIf you're planning to reach the top of the leaderboards or just get any good at this game, you'll need to use your keyboard to play – gamepads will be fine as a starting point, they may even feel more intuitive and natural, but as the difficulty ramps up, you will find that you've hit a glass ceiling. You're allowed to customise the controls as much as you want, so play around with them and see what works!

ㅤㅤㅤOne of the actual reasons I'm so in love with this game (besides Sister Marija's [i]voluptuous[/i] hips, of course) is the fact that, like all rhythm games, it offers the feeling of real, almost tangible progression. Here's a song that you couldn't beat two weeks ago and then forgot – now you can play it with 100% accuracy using just one hand (...) while barely breaking a sweat. Successfully learning new skills is possibly the most satisfying thing our brains can experience – and Muse Dash takes that empowering feeling, bottles it neatly and sells at a rather affordable price. You can't miss this deal, man.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844151368
ㅤㅤㅤThat is not to say that the game is outright perfect. It's got its own share of blemishes, and some of the most notable ones (in my experience) are:

ㅤㅤㅤ• [b]the ranking system is somewhat flawed[/b] – once I attempted to play a song that was clearly out of my league; I missed 23 times, nearly died and still got an [b]A[/b]. Like, come on... There are in-game (not Steam) achievements for getting ten [b]C[/b]s – what am I supposed to do to get a [b]C[/b], fall asleep while playing? 

ㅤㅤㅤ• [b]some characters have useless skills[/b] – basically, there are three girls, but each one has several variations that grant certain perks; most of these perks have no use whatsoever. Sister Marija's visual design and music are simply the best and I wanted to pick her, but all she does is flip around the ground and the air notes. Why would anyone want that, what's the point?

ㅤㅤㅤ• [b]no way to create song collections[/b] – anyone who's ever played [i]osu![/i] knows what I'm talking about. Sometimes, a particular song has a certain pattern of notes that you want to practice more, but you can't create a custom folder with songs like that – you can only choose Favourites. I'm thus forced to keep a Notepad document with this data, which is super inconvenient (|||❛︵❛.)

ㅤㅤㅤ• [b]slightly broken English at times[/b] – I know that the developers are not native speakers, no big deal, but how hard can it be to hire a proofreader?..

ㅤㅤㅤAll of these, while positively annoying, don't [i]really[/i] get in the way of the fun – and the devs are working hard to make their game better. For example, song search – a feature that was much coveted by all players – was added recently. It's nice to know that there's someone who's listening to feedback and taking notes. 

ㅤㅤㅤ📌Overall, Muse Dash makes an impression of a game that, at its core, isn't about trying hard or pushing your limits – it's about enjoying the moment. The enjoyment is made easier with all the... u-um... [i]gorgeous[/i] colours and, you know... [i]inviting[/i] mechanics! Yeah. Sure. (つ﹏<)

153492839,english,"I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

71174956,english,"A cute rhythm game with kawaii anime girls. While the DLC seems expensive, it gives you access to all the songs packs and more will be added in the future for free. You also get an EXP Boost. The base game does have 30+ songs, so the price - CDN$ 3.39 for me - is fair. I had a blast playing it and I’ll go back for more. My favorite songs are Breaking Dawn, Disco Night, midstream jam, Bass Telekinesis, Cotton Candy Wonderland, Tsukuyomi, Glimmer, EXIST, Out of Sense, Thirty Million Persona, Irreplaceable and one song by ANK feat kumako (the title is in Chinese).  

Now, I didn't follow the controversies with the devs/publisher, so I won't comment on those. Too bad the DLC with all songs will be removed for ""packs"".",1592830929,1700616697,True,25,1,0.705256283283233643,0,True,False,False,False,,76561198168716605,3119,47,1518,0,321,1669504702
